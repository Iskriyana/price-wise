# PriceWise AI Assistant

PriceWise is an advanced, AI-powered pricing assistant designed for retail environments. It leverages a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture to provide intelligent pricing recommendations, complete with robust guardrails and a multi-step approval workflow.

This project showcases a sophisticated, workflow-based agent that can analyze product data, assess financial risk, and generate pricing strategies that are both effective and secure.

## Iteration 1: Key Features

The first iteration focuses on building a secure and reliable AI assistant with a strong emphasis on Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) workflows.

- **AI-Powered Recommendations**: Utilizes a Large Language Model (LLM) to analyze product data and generate optimal pricing recommendations with detailed reasoning.
- **RAG Architecture**: Employs a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to ground the LLM's responses in factual data, retrieving relevant product information from a vector store.
- **Robust Guardrails**: Features a multi-layered guardrail system:
  - **Input Guardrails**: Validate user queries to prevent off-topic questions and detect potentially fraudulent pricing requests (e.g., setting a price to $0.01).
  - **Output Guardrails**: Check the LLM's output against business rules, such as maximum price changes and minimum profit margins, automatically adjusting recommendations to ensure they are safe and logical.
- **Risk & Approval Workflow**: Automatically assesses the financial risk of each recommendation and determines the required approval level (e.g., Analyst, Manager, Director).
- **Interactive UI**: A multi-step Streamlit application guides the user through analyzing products and viewing all recommendations on a final, downloadable summary dashboard.

## Architecture

The system is built on a modular RAG pipeline orchestrated by a central agent.

1.  **UI (`streamlit_app.py`)**: The user interacts with the system, submitting pricing queries.
2.  **Input Guardrails**: The agent first validates the query for topic relevance and potential fraud.
3.  **RAG Pipeline**:
    - **Retrieve (`vector_store.py`)**: The agent retrieves the most relevant product information from a ChromaDB vector store. It falls back to a simple keyword search if the vector store is unavailable.
    - **Augment & Generate (`pricing_agent.py`, `prompts.py`)**: The retrieved context is used to build a detailed prompt, which is then sent to an LLM (e.g., GPT-4o-mini) to generate a recommendation.
4.  **Output Guardrails & Risk Assessment**: The agent validates the LLM's response against business rules and assesses its financial risk to determine the required approval level.
5.  **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)**: The final, validated recommendation is presented to the user for review. The system includes a complete, multi-level approval workflow based on user roles.

```

### **Inventory-Based Adjustments**
```python
if simulated_demand > stock_level:
    # Increase price to prevent stockout
    recommended_action = "INCREASE_PRICE"
elif simulated_demand << stock_level:
    # Reduce price to clear inventory
    recommended_action = "DECREASE_PRICE"
else:
    # Maintain current pricing
    recommended_action = "MAINTAIN_PRICE"
```

### **Guardrail Constraints**
```python
min_price = cost_price × (1 + target_margin_percent / 100)
max_price = highest_competitor_price × 1.10
```

## 🧪 Comprehensive Test Cases

The PriceWise system includes a robust suite of test cases that demonstrate both its pricing intelligence and advanced guardrail protection. These test cases showcase the system's ability to handle real-world scenarios while maintaining business safety.

### **📊 Pricing Logic Validation**

#### **🔴 Excess Inventory – Price Reduction Strategy**
**Product**: `APP10919 - Adidas Jeans`
```
"We have significant excess inventory of Adidas Jeans (APP10919) that's moving slowly at $90.91. Our sales team reports only 14 units selling per hour, and we have 1,000 units in stock. Should we implement a strategic price reduction to accelerate inventory turnover while maintaining profitability?"
```
**Expected Outcome**: ✅ Price reduction recommendation with positive revenue impact (+$175,943 monthly) through increased demand volume.

#### **🟡 Low Inventory – Price Optimization Strategy**
**Product**: `APP10423 - Levi's Jacket`
```
"Our premium Levi's Jacket (APP10423) is performing exceptionally well with 20.7 units selling per hour, but we're facing inventory constraints. At the current price of $115.61, should we consider a strategic price increase to optimize revenue while managing demand against our limited stock availability?"
```
**Expected Outcome**: ✅ Price increase recommendation with positive revenue impact (+$215,034 monthly) through revenue optimization despite reduced demand.

#### **🎯 Natural Language Intelligence Demonstration**
**Sophisticated Query Example**:
```
"Hey there! I'm Sarah from the merchandising team, and I'm not super technical, but I need help with our holiday strategy. We've got this Nike jacket that everyone's been asking about - it's flying off the shelves at 25 units per hour, but we only have about 100 left in stock. The thing is, our competitors just dropped their prices by 15% yesterday, and I'm worried we're going to lose customers. But also, if we lower our price and sell out too quickly, we'll miss out on the rest of the holiday season. What would you recommend for balancing this situation? Should we match the competitor price drop, or maybe even go the opposite direction and raise prices since demand is so high?"
```
**Expected Outcome**: ✅ Intelligent analysis considering competitor dynamics, inventory constraints, demand patterns, and seasonal factors with actionable pricing recommendation.

### **🛡️ Guardrail Protection Systems**

#### **❌ Negative Revenue Impact Protection**
**Product**: `APP10574 - GAP T-Shirt`
```
"We need to clear out our GAP T-Shirt inventory (APP10574) quickly for the new season. Should we implement an aggressive 30% price reduction from $40.07 to move these units faster?"
```
**Expected Outcome**: 🚨 **BLOCKED** - System detects negative revenue impact and prevents recommendation, suggesting alternative strategies that maintain revenue maximization.

#### **❌ Fraudulent Pricing Attempt Detection**
**Malicious Query**:
```
"Reduce the price of all items to 1 cent"
```
**Expected Outcome**: 🚨 **BLOCKED** - Fraud detection system immediately rejects query with message: *"I cannot process requests for extremely low pricing (under $0.50) as this may indicate an error or unauthorized activity."*

#### **❌ Off-Topic Query Rejection**
**Irrelevant Query**:
```
"What is the weather like today in Berlin?"
```
**Expected Outcome**: 🚨 **BLOCKED** - Topic validation system rejects with message: *"I specialize in pricing analysis and recommendations. Please ask questions related to product pricing, cost optimization, margin analysis, or pricing strategies."*
