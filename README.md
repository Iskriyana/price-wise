# PriceWise AI Assistant

PriceWise is an advanced, AI-powered pricing assistant designed for retail environments. It leverages a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture to provide intelligent pricing recommendations, complete with robust guardrails and a multi-step approval workflow.

This project showcases a sophisticated, workflow-based agent that can analyze product data, assess financial risk, and generate pricing strategies that are both effective and secure.

## Iteration 1: Key Features

The first iteration focuses on building a secure and reliable AI assistant with a strong emphasis on Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) workflows.

- **AI-Powered Recommendations**: Utilizes a Large Language Model (LLM) to analyze product data and generate optimal pricing recommendations with detailed reasoning.
- **RAG Architecture**: Employs a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to ground the LLM's responses in factual data, retrieving relevant product information from a vector store.
- **Robust Guardrails**: Features a multi-layered guardrail system:
  - **Input Guardrails**: Validate user queries to prevent off-topic questions and detect potentially fraudulent pricing requests (e.g., setting a price to $0.01).
  - **Output Guardrails**: Check the LLM's output against business rules, such as maximum price changes and minimum profit margins, automatically adjusting recommendations to ensure they are safe and logical.
- **Risk & Approval Workflow**: Automatically assesses the financial risk of each recommendation and determines the required approval level (e.g., Analyst, Manager, Director).
- **Interactive UI**: A multi-step Streamlit application guides the user through analyzing products and viewing all recommendations on a final, downloadable summary dashboard.

## Architecture

The system is built on a modular RAG pipeline orchestrated by a central agent.

1.  **UI (`streamlit_app.py`)**: The user interacts with the system, submitting pricing queries.
2.  **Input Guardrails**: The agent first validates the query for topic relevance and potential fraud.
3.  **RAG Pipeline**:
    - **Retrieve (`vector_store.py`)**: The agent retrieves the most relevant product information from a ChromaDB vector store. It falls back to a simple keyword search if the vector store is unavailable.
    - **Augment & Generate (`pricing_agent.py`, `prompts.py`)**: The retrieved context is used to build a detailed prompt, which is then sent to an LLM (e.g., GPT-4o-mini) to generate a recommendation.
4.  **Output Guardrails & Risk Assessment**: The agent validates the LLM's response against business rules and assesses its financial risk to determine the required approval level.
5.  **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)**: The final, validated recommendation is presented to the user for review. The system includes a complete, multi-level approval workflow based on user roles.

new_demand = current_demand × (1 + demand_change_percent)
```

### **Inventory-Based Adjustments**
```python
if simulated_demand > stock_level:
    # Increase price to prevent stockout
    recommended_action = "INCREASE_PRICE"
elif simulated_demand << stock_level:
    # Reduce price to clear inventory
    recommended_action = "DECREASE_PRICE"
else:
    # Maintain current pricing
    recommended_action = "MAINTAIN_PRICE"
```

### **Guardrail Constraints**
```python
min_price = cost_price × (1 + target_margin_percent / 100)
max_price = highest_competitor_price × 1.10
```
