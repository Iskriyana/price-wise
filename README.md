# ⚡ PriceWise AI: Real-Time Pricing Agent

**High-Velocity Sales Event Optimizer with Price Elasticity Modeling & Demand Simulation**

Welcome to **PriceWise AI** - an enterprise-grade real-time pricing system designed for high-velocity sales events (Black Friday, flash sales, promotional periods). The system combines Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with advanced price elasticity modeling, demand simulation, and enterprise guardrails.

## 🎯 Project Vision

Transform retail pricing during high-velocity sales events through intelligent automation with real-time demand simulation and inventory management. This system progresses through three iterations:

- **✅ Iteration 1**: Real-Time Pricing Agent with price elasticity modeling & demand simulation
- **🔄 Iteration 2**: Semi-autonomous agent with financial simulation & planning capabilities  
- **⏳ Iteration 3**: Multi-agent system with autonomous monitoring & execution

## 🏆 Current Status: Real-Time Pricing Agent (Iteration 1) Complete

### ⚡ **Real-Time Pricing Agent Features**

#### 🧠 **Price Elasticity Modeling**
- **Demand Simulation**: Calculate projected demand using `% change in demand = price_elasticity × % change in price`
- **Scenario Analysis**: Show impact of ±5% and ±10% price changes on demand and revenue
- **Revenue Optimization**: Maximize revenue while maintaining margin requirements
- **Inventory Balance**: Prevent stockouts and manage excess inventory

#### 📊 **High-Velocity Sales Event Optimization**
- **Flash Sale Pricing**: Optimize prices for 6-hour flash sales with demand forecasting
- **Black Friday Strategy**: Handle competitor price drops and high inventory scenarios
- **Stockout Prevention**: Automatically increase prices when demand exceeds inventory
- **Excess Inventory Management**: Reduce prices to clear stock while maintaining margins

#### 🛡️ **Advanced Guardrails**
- **Minimum Price Protection**: Never below `cost_price × (1 + target_margin_percent / 100)`
- **Competitive Positioning**: Never more than 10% above highest competitor price
- **Risk Assessment**: 4-tier classification with automatic approval escalation
- **Financial Impact Analysis**: Revenue projections with quantified business impact

#### 🔄 **Multi-Level Approval Workflows**
- **Role-Based Authority**: Analyst ($50) → Senior Analyst ($150) → Manager ($500) → Director (unlimited)
- **Price Change Limits**: Authority based on absolute dollar change amount
- **Real-time Approval**: Instant approval/rejection with audit trail
- **Authority Validation**: Prevents unauthorized pricing decisions

## 💡 Core Capabilities

### **Real-Time Demand Simulation**
```bash
Query: "Optimize Nike Air Max pricing for flash sale event"
System: 
├── 📊 Current Demand: 24 units/day at $89.99
├── 🧮 Price Scenarios:
│   ├── -10%: $80.99 → 29 units/day → +$145 revenue
│   ├── -5%: $85.49 → 26 units/day → +$78 revenue  
│   ├── +5%: $94.49 → 22 units/day → +$99 revenue
│   └── +10%: $98.99 → 20 units/day → +$180 revenue
├── 📦 Inventory: 450 units (18 days supply)
├── 🎯 Recommendation: $94.49 (balanced demand/inventory)
└── ⚡ Approval: Senior Analyst required ($4.50 change)
```

### **Inventory Risk Management**
- **Stockout Detection**: Increase prices when simulated demand > stock
- **Excess Inventory**: Reduce prices when demand << stock levels
- **Days of Inventory**: Calculate runway based on demand projections
- **Dynamic Adjustments**: Real-time price optimization based on sales velocity

### **Enterprise Reliability**
- **100% Uptime**: Dual retrieval system with automatic fallbacks
- **Cross-Platform**: Mac/Windows/Linux compatibility with CoreML fallback
- **Graceful Degradation**: Continues operation even without OpenAI API
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Full audit trail for compliance

## 🚀 Quick Start

### **1. Setup Environment**
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/price-wise.git
cd price-wise/iteration_1

# Install dependencies  
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Optional: Configure OpenAI API key
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key-here"
```

## 📊 Real-Time Pricing Logic

### **Price Elasticity Formula**
```
% change in demand = price_elasticity × % change in price
```

### **Inventory-Based Adjustments**
```python
if simulated_demand > stock_level:
    # Increase price to prevent stockout
    recommended_action = "INCREASE_PRICE"
elif simulated_demand << stock_level:
    # Reduce price to clear inventory
    recommended_action = "DECREASE_PRICE"
else:
    # Maintain current pricing
    recommended_action = "MAINTAIN_PRICE"
```

### **Guardrail Constraints**
```python
min_price = cost_price × (1 + target_margin_percent / 100)
max_price = highest_competitor_price × 1.10
```
