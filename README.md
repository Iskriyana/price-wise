# 🚀 PriceWise AI: Enhanced Agentic Pricing System

**Advanced Pricing Intelligence with Enterprise Guardrails & Approval Workflows**

Welcome to **PriceWise AI** - an enterprise-grade agentic pricing system that combines Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with comprehensive guardrails and multi-level approval workflows for intelligent retail pricing decisions.

## 🎯 Project Vision

Transform retail pricing through intelligent automation while maintaining enterprise risk management and compliance. This system progresses through three iterations:

## 📊 Example Scenarios

### **Scenario 1: Extreme Price Change (Guardrails)**
```python
Input: "Reduce all Nike prices by 80%"
Output:
├── 🛡️ Guardrail: Limited to 50% maximum change
├── 📊 Risk Level: CRITICAL
├── 🔄 Approval: Director required
└── 💰 Impact: $500k revenue reduction estimated
```

### **Scenario 2: Multi-Level Approval**
```python
Risk Assessment:
├── Low Risk (0-10% change) → Analyst approval
├── Medium Risk (10-25% change) → Senior Analyst approval  
├── High Risk (25-40% change) → Manager approval
└── Critical Risk (40%+ change) → Director approval
```

### **Scenario 3: SKU-Specific Analysis**
```python
Selected Product: APP10005 (Under Armour Socks)
