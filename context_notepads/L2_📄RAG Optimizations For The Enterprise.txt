📄RAG Optimizations For The Enterprise
Lesson 6
These RAG techniques help improve retrieval accuracy, reduce irrelevant information, and enhance response generation.
________________


1. Query Expansion
Reference: Query Expansion in LangChain
* Key Concept: Expands the original query by including synonyms or related terms to improve retrieval.
* When to Use: Best for customer support chatbots, e-commerce search engines, and knowledge base retrieval, where slight wording differences impact results.
* When NOT to Use: Ineffective for highly structured or domain-specific queries where meaning cannot be altered.
* Additional Costs: Minimal—only requires synonym matching.
* Effort: Low—can be implemented with simple embedding lookups and synonym lists.

2. HyDE (Hypothetical Document Embeddings)
Paper: Hypothetical Document Embeddings for Zero-Shot Dense Passage Retrieval
* Key Concept: Generates a hypothetical answer as an enriched query, improving search relevance.
* When to Use: Useful for retrieving case law precedents, market research, and summarizing long documents, where a richer context enhances retrieval.
* When NOT to Use: Overhead is unnecessary for keyword-based searches or structured queries where retrieval precision is already high. Avoid using it in niche domains with limited LLM knowledge, as it may generate irrelevant or misleading results.
* Additional Costs: Medium—requires an additional LLM generation step.
* Effort: Low—requires only prompt modifications but increases inference latency.

3. Hybrid Search
Reference: https://weaviate.io/blog/hybrid-search-explained
* Key Concept: Combines keyword-based retrieval and semantic search (vector embeddings) for better accuracy.
* When to Use: Ideal for legal discovery, customer feedback analysis, and HR resume filtering, where exact matches and semantic meaning both matter.
* When NOT to Use: Inefficient for simple queries where either keyword search or vector search alone is sufficient.
* Additional Costs: Medium—requires maintaining two retrieval methods and reranking outputs.
* Effort: Low-Medium—requires hybrid search infrastructure but is easy to scale.

4. graphRAG
Reference: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/graphrag-unlocking-llm-discovery-on-narrative-private-data/
* Key Concept: Uses graph-based structures and traversal algorithms to connect related information across multiple documents.
* When to Use: Best for fraud detection, knowledge graphs, and enterprise analytics, where relationships between retrieved documents enhance understanding.
* When NOT to Use: Overhead is unnecessary for single-turn queries with no need for relationship mapping. Not worth the effort if data conversion is time-consuming and other options have not been tested out.
* Additional Costs: High—requires additional graph construction and traversal operations.
* Effort: Medium-High—requires integrating knowledge graphs into RAG pipelines.

5. Corrective RAG
Paper: Corrective Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Reliable Question Answering
* Key Concept: Iteratively refines retrieval results by detecting gaps and triggering follow-up queries.
* When to Use: Useful for medical research, financial analysis, and investigative journalism, where retrieving partial information requires iterative refinement.
* When NOT to Use: Unnecessary when retrieval is sufficient on the first pass, such as simple fact lookups.
* Additional Costs: High—requires multiple retrieval iterations and feedback loops.
* Effort: Medium-High—needs logic for iterative correction and response validation.
6. Fine-Tuned AI Models For RAG
📄 Paper: Fine-tuning LLMs for Multi-Hop Retrieval-Augmented Generation
* Key Concept: Uses domain-specific fine-tuning to improve retrieval accuracy for specialized applications.
* When to Use: Best for legal compliance, pharmaceutical research, and defense intelligence, where generic retrieval models fail to capture domain nuances. Should never be used without benchmarking generic models first!
* When NOT to Use: Not worth the investment for general-purpose Q&A or casual search applications.
* Additional Costs: High—requires labeled domain-specific training data and fine-tuning.
* Effort: High—needs specialized ML expertise for tuning and deployment.
