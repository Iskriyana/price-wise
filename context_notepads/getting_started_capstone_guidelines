📄Getting Started: Capstone Guidelines
Lesson 2
Collaboration & Roles
Your final deliverable is a presentation showcasing your design, iterations, and (optionally) your build. Collaboration is key. Use the shared scratchpad (will be provided as a Google doc) as your workspace.
During the first 5 minutes of brainstorming, decide who takes on which roles—though you’re free to contribute across areas as needed:
●	Writer/Designer: Documents ideas and designs the solution.
●	Researcher: Gathers best practices and optimization strategies.
●	Brainstormers/Strategy Heads: Shape the approach and plan iterations.
●	Builder/Engineer (Optional): Implements and tests the system.
●	Presenters: Deliver the final demo.
As always, you're free to use AI assistance as long as you understand the problem and main ideas.
These guidelines apply to all iterations and do not require responses—use them as a framework for structuring your approach.
1.	Design Your Solution
●	Use your Canva poster template or exalidraw (or any diagramming tool) to create a high-level architecture diagram and share your design.
●	Identify what types of data might be needed—consider both inputs and outputs relevant to your use case.
●	Bonus: If you find a real dataset online that aligns with your use case, include it in your discussion and try to include it in your implementation for deeper insights.
2.	Define the Specifics of Your Design
●	Answer the iteration-specific design questions provided in the assignment.
●	Justify your choices based on practicality, efficiency, and alignment with course concepts.
3.	Establish Evaluation Metrics (From Lesson 7 in this module)
●	What evaluation metrics will you use, and why?
●	Provide a brief explanation of your choices—how do these metrics help assess performance meaningfully?
4.	Consider Optimizations (From Lessons 3-5)
●	Based on your use case, are there any potential optimizations that could improve performance?
●	If your use case needs to be run first before considering optimizations, mention it explicitly—some decisions require data-driven insights.
5.	Perform Cost, Latency & Effort Analysis (From Lessons 3-5 for optimizations and Lesson 7 on Operational Metrics)
●	Estimate the cost, latency, and effort required for implementation:
●	Cost & Latency: Where is cost/latency creeping in? Consider factors such as:
●	Increased token usage (input/output)
●	Multiple LLM calls
●	Vector database storage and retrieval
●	Effort:
●	Categorize the effort level as low, medium, or high, based on what you've learned in class.
●	Justify your rating—why do you consider it high/medium/low?
Note: You don’t need exact numbers, simply explaining where costs and latency arise is valuable.
6.	Business & Compliance Considerations (Guardrails from here, or lookup online)
●	What guardrails are necessary at this stage?
●	Are there any compliance requirements relevant to your industry or use case?
If applicable, consider data privacy, security, or regulatory constraints that may impact your design.
