# 🎯 Iteration 1 Summary: RAG-Powered Pricing Agent

**Completion Date**: June 25, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ Successfully Implemented & Tested  
**Repository**: [price-wise/iteration_1/](./iteration_1/)  
**Live Demo**: http://localhost:8501 (Streamlit UI)

## 📋 Project Overview

Built a comprehensive RAG-powered pricing analyst system for retail enterprises, implementing enterprise AI best practices with multiple interfaces and robust fallback mechanisms.

## 🏗️ Architecture Implemented

### Core RAG Workflow (4 Steps)
1. **Context Retrieval**: Semantic search for relevant products
2. **Business Rules**: Mathematical validation and margin analysis  
3. **LLM Generation**: Intelligent recommendation synthesis
4. **Guardrails**: Safety checks and approval thresholds
