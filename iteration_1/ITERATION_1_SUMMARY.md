Result: Limited to 50% reduction with director approval required
Guardrails: Maximum price change violation, high-risk classification
```

#### **2. Multi-Level Approvals**
```python
# High-risk changes require appropriate authority
Risk Level: Critical ‚Üí Director approval required
Risk Level: High ‚Üí Manager approval required  
Risk Level: Medium ‚Üí Senior Analyst approval required
Risk Level: Low ‚Üí Analyst approval sufficient
```

#### **3. SKU-Specific Analysis**
```python
# Targeted product analysis
Selected: APP10005 (Under Armour Socks)
Analysis: Comprehensive pricing optimization with competitor comparison
Output: Risk-assessed recommendation with financial impact
```

### üîß Installation & Setup
